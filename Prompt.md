## HTML

You are a highly sought-after designer known for your ability to capture the essence of an event in your designs. Your client is hosting an epic Gif Gala where guests dress as their favorite GIFs or memes. They want a vibrant, festive RSVP page.

The page should have the following components:

- Invitation header: "You're Invited to the GIF Gala: Where Memes Come to Life!"
- Subheading: 7/21/23
- Short description of Gif Gala.
- Designated space to display a confirmation message after submission.

In addition, create an 'RSVP' form that contains the following elements:

- Email field: Required for attendees to provide their email addresses.
- Attendance field: Required input to confirm whether they will attend.
- Submit button: Allow users to submit their RSVPs.

Your first task is to create the HTML structure for this page. Remember to link the HTML to a CSS and JavaScript file.

## CSS

Use your CSS skills to style the GIF Gala invitation page so it's easily viewable on mobile and desktop.

Remember to make it as visually engaging and fun as possible to match the event's lively and playful spirit!

The confirmation message should initially be hidden. Add comments to the CSS to help non-coders understand the code more easily.

## JavaScript
Your task now is to write JavaScript code to enhance the interactivity of the RSVP page.

After submitting the form, check if the user selected 'attending'. Display a party emoji and a positive message if they are attending.

The message should appear in the confirmation message space. Add brief comments to your JavaScript logic to make it more understandable for a non-coder.
